Apologies for any confusion in my earlier responses. You're correct; with the **Patch 2.7.0 update**, the Follower system in *Diablo III* underwent significant changes. Followers now have access to **14 equipment slots**, mirroring the player's gear slots, plus an additional slot for a Follower-specific item. This update also introduced the **Emanate** mechanic, allowing certain Legendary and Set item effects equipped on Followers to benefit the player.

**Follower Equipment Slots:**

1. Head
2. Shoulders
3. Neck (Amulet)
4. Torso (Chest Armor)
5. Wrists (Bracers)
6. Hands (Gloves)
7. Waist (Belt)
8. Legs (Pants)
9. Feet (Boots)
10. Left Finger (Ring 1)
11. Right Finger (Ring 2)
12. Main-Hand (Weapon)
13. Off-Hand (Shield or Off-Hand Item)
14. Follower Relic (Specific to each Follower)

**Emanate Mechanic:**

The **Emanate** feature allows specific Legendary and Set item effects equipped on Followers to apply to the player. This enhances the player's capabilities without occupying their own gear slots. Not all items have Emanate effects, but notable ones include:

- **Broken Crown (Head):** When a gem drops, a gem of the type socketed in your helmet also drops.
- **Nemesis Bracers (Wrists):** Shrines and Pylons spawn an enemy champion.
- **The Flavor of Time (Amulet):** Pylon effects last twice as long.
- **Ring of Royal Grandeur (Ring):** Reduces the number of items needed for set bonuses by one (to a minimum of 2).
- **Sage's Journey Set (3-piece set bonus):** Increases Death's Breath drops.
- **Cain's Destiny Set (3-piece set bonus):** Increases Greater Rift Keystone drops.

For a comprehensive list of items with Emanate effects and detailed Follower mechanics, you can refer to the [Follower Skills and Gearing Guide on Icy Veins](https://www.icy-veins.com/d3/follower-skills-and-gearing-guide).

By strategically equipping your Follower with items that have Emanate effects, you can significantly boost your farming efficiency and overall gameplay experience.
