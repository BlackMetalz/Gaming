### **Best Follower Setup for Whirlwind Rend Barbarian**  
A properly geared **Follower** can provide **massive utility**, including **extra damage, cooldown reduction, survivability, and experience gain**. Since the **Follower update in Patch 2.7**, they **keep all equipped legendary powers** (via **Emanate**), making them extremely powerful.

---

## **1. Best Follower Choice: Enchantress (Best for GR & Speed Farming)**
💡 **Why the Enchantress?**  
- **Provides Cooldown Reduction (CDR)** → Helps maintain **permanent Wrath of the Berserker (WOTB)**.  
- **Grants Attack Speed & Armor Buffs** → More DPS and survivability.  
- **Can Wear Flavor of Time (Double Pylon Duration)** → Huge boost for GR pushing.  

🔹 **Alternative:** If you want **extra defense**, use **Templar (Healing & Resource Regen)** instead.

## **2. Best Follower Skills (Enchantress)**
| **Skill** | **Why?** |
|------------|----------|
| **Temporal Pulse** | Slows enemies = More Bane of the Trapped uptime. |
| **Prophetic Harmony** | Reduces your cooldowns = More Wrath of the Berserker uptime. |
| **Erosion** | Extra AoE damage for GR pushing. |
| **Focused Mind** | Increases Attack Speed (More WW procs & Rend damage). |

🔹 **For Speed Farming:** Swap **Erosion → Missile Ward** (More toughness).
