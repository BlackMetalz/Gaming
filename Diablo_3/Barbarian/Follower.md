### **Best Follower Setup for Whirlwind Rend Barbarian**  
A properly geared **Follower** can provide **massive utility**, including **extra damage, cooldown reduction, survivability, and experience gain**. Since the **Follower update in Patch 2.7**, they **keep all equipped legendary powers** (via **Emanate**), making them extremely powerful.

🔹 **Alternative:** If you want **extra defense**, use **Templar (Healing & Resource Regen)** instead.
