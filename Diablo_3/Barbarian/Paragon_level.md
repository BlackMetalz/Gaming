### **Paragon Point Guide for Whirlwind Rend Barbarian (900 Paragon)**
Since you're at **Paragon Level 900**, you have **900 points** to distribute across the four categories: **Core, Offense, Defense, and Utility**. Here’s the best way to allocate them efficiently.

---

## **1. Paragon Point Distribution**
### **Core (Max 200 per stat)**
| **Priority** | **Points Allocation** |
|-------------|----------------------|
| 🥇 **Movement Speed** | **50 Points (or until 25%)** |
| 🥈 **Strength** | **All Remaining Points** |
| 🥉 **Vitality** (if needed) | **Optional, 50-100 points max** |
| 🎯 **Maximum Fury** | **0 Points (Not needed for this build)** |

💡 **Explanation:**  
- **Maxing out Movement Speed (25%)** helps with speed farming.  
- **Dump everything else into Strength** for more damage.  
- **Vitality is optional** if you feel too squishy in GR pushing.

---

### **Offense**
| **Priority** | **Points Allocation** |
|-------------|----------------------|
| 🥇 **Critical Hit Chance** | **50 Points (Max)** |
| 🥈 **Critical Hit Damage** | **50 Points (Max)** |
| 🥉 **Cooldown Reduction** | **50 Points (Max for GR Pushing)** |
| 🏅 **Attack Speed** | **Rest of the points** |

💡 **Explanation:**  
- **Crit Chance & Crit Damage** boost Rend and Whirlwind damage.  
- **Cooldown Reduction (CDR)** is important for **Wrath of the Berserker uptime** (especially for GR pushing).  
- **Attack Speed is secondary** because Rend isn't AS-dependent.

---

### **Defense**
| **Priority** | **Points Allocation** |
|-------------|----------------------|
| 🥇 **Resist All** | **50 Points (Max)** |
| 🥈 **Armor** | **50 Points (Max)** |
| 🥉 **Life %** | **50 Points (Max)** |
| 🏅 **Life Regen** | **Rest of the points** |

💡 **Explanation:**  
- **Resist All & Armor** give better survivability, especially in high GRs.  
- **Life % helps scale toughness** (especially if using Squirt’s Necklace).  
- **Life Regen is the least useful stat**, so put leftover points there.

---

### **Utility**
| **Priority** | **Points Allocation** |
|-------------|----------------------|
| 🥇 **Area Damage** | **50 Points (Max)** |
| 🥈 **Resource Cost Reduction** | **50 Points (Max for GR Pushing)** |
| 🥉 **Life per Hit** | **Rest of the points** |
| 🏅 **Gold Find** | **Only for T16 Speed Farming** |

💡 **Explanation:**  
- **Area Damage is crucial for Rend explosions.**  
- **Resource Cost Reduction helps Whirlwind spam (but not as important for BK weapons).**  
- **Life per Hit helps sustain** during Whirlwind.  
- **Gold Find is useless in Greater Rifts** but good in Torment 16 farming.

## **2. Gameplay Tips for Speed Farming & Greater Rift Pushing**
### **Speed Farming (Torment 16)**
✅ Use **Bul-Kathos’s Oath** for **+45% movement speed**.  
✅ Whirlwind through enemies—don’t stop!  
✅ Use **Wreath of Lightning Gem + Sprint** for more speed.  
✅ Consider using **Goldwrap + Avarice Band** for infinite toughness.  
✅ Swap **Bane of the Stricken → Boon of the Hoarder** in T16.

---

### **Greater Rift Pushing (GR100+)**
✅ Swap to **Ambo’s Pride + Furnace** for **higher damage**.  
✅ Manually **cast Rend every 5 seconds** to **stack twice**.  
✅ **Keep Wrath of the Berserker active** at all times (use Obsidian Ring).  
✅ **Time Convention of Elements (Physical phase) for max damage.**  
✅ **Use Band of Might for 80% DR** if survivability is an issue.  
✅ **Dodge elite affixes** (Molten, Arcane, Electrified) to keep Squirt’s Necklace bonus.

## **3. What’s Next?**
At **Paragon 900**, you’re already strong, but to push **GR 110+**, you should:  
- **Increase Critical Hit Chance (60%+) and Critical Hit Damage (600%+)** via better gear.  
- **Aim for 50%+ Cooldown Reduction** to keep WOTB active all the time.  
- **Level up your Legendary Gems (Bane of the Stricken for high GRs).**  
- **Get a primal or high Ancient Ambo’s Pride + Lamentation Belt.**
